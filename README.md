Hi!

If you're reading this, you are probably about to run the Denver CLI survey.

If not, you can run it using the following command

`source <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zachlloyd/denver-survey-client/master/install.sh)`

This repo holds all the client-side code for the survey.  
Feel free to check it out if you're wondering what's going on beneath the hood.

Please send any questions to zachlloyd@gmail.com
